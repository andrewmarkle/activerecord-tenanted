# Contributing to activerecord-tenanted

## Getting up and running

- clone this repository
- `bundle install`
- `bin/test`, which will run:
  - rubocop checks
  - unit tests
  - integration tests


## Test scenarios

Most tests rely on one or more "scenarios" being loaded. A "scenario" is a combination of:

- database configuration
- model configuration

and the `database.yml` and model files are all located under `test/scenarios/`.

In the unit testing suite, there are some scenario helpers (e.g., `for_each_scenario`) in `test/test_helper.rb` that allow us to run the tests under one or more scenarios using nested `describe` blocks.


## Running unit tests

Isolate the unit tests with `bin/test-unit`. The test files are all under `test/unit/`.


## Running integration tests

Isolate the integration testing suite with `bin/test-integration`, which:

- for each scenario
  - makes a copy of the `test/smarty/` app
  - write the scenario files: database.yml, models, and migrations
  - copy the config and test files from `test/integration/`
  - setup the databases
  - run the integration tests
